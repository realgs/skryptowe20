<h2>Exchange rates and sales API</h2>
<p>This API provides exchange rates of three currencies (USD, EUR, GBP)
    and data on total sales in two currencies - original (USD)
    and converted at the exchange rate of the National Bank of Poland (PLN).</p>
<p>Exchange rate data and sales data are from 2014-12-28 to 2016-12-28.</p>
<p>Date format used is <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b>, e.g. 2015-10-13.</p>
<p>Exchange rate data - property <i>interpolated</i> is set to true for days that had no value
    and took their value from the previous (or next, depending on the situation) day
    that had the exchange rate. False otherwise.</p>
